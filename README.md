# Directing-Customers-to-Subscription-Through-App-Behavior-Analysis

To attract customers, company releases a free version of their app with some of the main features unlocked. The company has tasked us to identify which user will not enroll in the paid products so that additional offers can be given to them. Because of the cost of these offers, it will not given to everybody, especially customers who enroll anyways.
